      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      const players1 = players;
      console.log("players:", players, "players1:", players1);

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      players2 = players.slice();
      console.log("players:", players, "players2:", players2);

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const players3 = [].concat(players);
      console.log("players:", players, "players3:", players3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const players4 = [...players];
      console.log("players:", players, "players4:", players4);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        "players3:",
        players3,
        "players4:",
        players4
      );

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const person1 = person;
      person1.age = 18;
      console.log("person:", person, "person1:", person1);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person2 = Object.assign({}, person);
      person2.age = 20;
      console.log("person:", person, "person2:", person2);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const person3 = { ...person };
      person3.age = 30;
      console.log("person:", person, "person3:", person3);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
